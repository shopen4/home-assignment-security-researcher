1. Mach ports: Mach ports are a kernel-provided inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism used heavily throughout the operating system. A Mach port is a unidirectional channel that can have multiple send endpoints and only one receive endpoint. Because they are unidirectional, a common way to use a Mach port is to send a message to the receiver, and to include another Mach port on which the receiver can reply to the sender.
2. Shared Memory: is a implementation for IPC where a memory section is shared between different processes.In other words process A writes to this memory and B can read from this memory, or vice verse. This is fast and data doesn’t have to be copied around. The downside is that it’s really difficult to coordinate changes to the shared memory area.
3. Sockets: While most TCP/IP connections are established over a network between two different machines, it is also possible to connect two processes running on the same machine without ever touching a network using TCP/IP.
